In March 2016, DeepMind's AlphaGo defeated 18 time World Champion and Nine Dan Go player(that's the highest rank there is in Go) Lee Sedol.

That was a breakthrough moment for Deep Learning. Go is an abstract strategy game with fairly simple rules but an enormous complexity, that goes much beyond chess. The possible number of moves in any game is statastically more than the total number of atoms in the visible universe.

The event thus marked the first time a machine had beaten the very best at this ancient and enormously complex gameâ€”a feat that, until recently, experts didn't expect would happen for another ten years.

Deep Learning is on a rise. Everyday we hear a tech giants releasing powerfull deep learning libraries and the next day we hear even bigger giants buying smart deep learning startups as billion dollars deals.

So how to begin with it?

Deep learning has many cool applications but among them, the simplest but grandest in scope is image recognition, classification and detection. There are a lot of options to go deep with python being the forerunner as laguage of choice. But again with the libraries to use, we have a plethora of options. The trouble with most of them is, they are overwhelmingly scary for beginners to play with. Preparing your system for deep learning itself takes days and every little error is diheartingly painfull . As a result, the cool stuff remains accessible only for the strong of heart.

But here coms YOLO, a state-of-the-art multi objection detection system based on Darknet and written in C.

Yes, you read right, this guy wrote it all in C.

YOLO stands for You Only Look Once (but you can always live twice). The system is a more advanced version of image classification as it does image detction too, that is, in an image with vrious objects, it tells what those objects are and also put a bounding box over it to tell its position.

Classification is a well studied problem in image recognition and various wonderful networks in deep learning have been able to do this job fairly well with some even surpassing human accuracies. But classification is usually done only for one object and it becomes very tough when the object to search for is in a crowded environment.

Detection on the other hand is a harder problem. This is because in addition to just classifying the image into what all categories it sees, the system has to tell where exactly it is.

Various papers have been published in Multi Object detection but for this post we will focus on YOLO.

In fact, we will do YOLOv2, an even powerful version of YOLO wih higher accuracies and a pretty decent speed.

Okay let's dive deep now.
